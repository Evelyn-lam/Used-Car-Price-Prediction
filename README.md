# Used-Car-Price-Prediction
 The objective of this project is to identify the price of used cars based on

 Car depreciation is a simple idea in theory. It’s all about the car’s market value.
 There are many factors which have an influence on the selling price of a car. 
 Further there are a lot of additional costs depending on the model, the millage, the fuel consumption etc. 
 Usually the older the car is, the less it will be worth. 
 For example, a new car might lose 20-30% of its value in only 1-2 years, but later the diminution might be slower. 
 A car loses less or more value every year depending of its type. Sometimes it can even increase in value.
